    <h2>🌱 What We Know</h2>
    <p>Your body is designed to heal itself. And it does—every second, through cell regeneration, detoxification, and immune defense.</p>
    <p>As long as your heart is still beating and there's air in your lungs, you're in constant healing.</p>
    <p>Daily habits, stressors, and exposure to toxins interfere with this natural process—rerouting healing into survival mode.</p>
    <p>The body holds a memory of wellness—and when given the right conditions, it leans toward that memory like a plant turns toward light.</p>
    <p><strong>Unblocked Living</strong> is about returning to the body’s natural rhythm and supporting what it’s already doing.</p>

    <h2>🛠️ Tools + Rituals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sea Moss</strong> — for daily cellular nourishment</li>
      <li><strong>Burdock + Dandelion Root</strong> — to clear, cleanse, and replenish</li>
      <li><strong>Alkaline Foods & Recipes</strong> — because what you eat creates what you feel</li>
      <li><strong>Castor Oil Packs</strong> — ancient support for the womb and liver</li>
      <li><strong>Grounding Practices</strong> — barefoot, breath, and boundaries</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These aren’t trends. They’re <em>tools to remember who we are.</em></p>

    <h2>🔁 Living It, Daily</h2>
    <p>Breath. Sun. Movement. Stillness. Water. Boundaries.<br>
    <em>Unblocked Living</em> is not a destination—it’s how we live every day.</p>

    <h2>📖 About Me</h2>
    <p>I didn’t believe the body could heal itself—I knew it.<br>
    When I first heard Dr. Sebi, it was like hearing my own thoughts come back to me.<br>
    <strong>Unblocked Living</strong> is my way of holding space for what I’ve always known—and maybe what you’ve always known too.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center; font-size: 2em; margin-bottom: 20px;">About Unblocked Living</h2>
  <p>
    Unblocked Living is about returning to the body’s natural rhythm and supporting what it’s already doing. 
    The human body is designed to heal itself — from the way a cut closes, to how bones regenerate, to the 
    brain’s ability to adapt and form new connections.
  </p>
  <p>
    When we align with nature through nourishment, movement, and rest, we support that built-in wisdom. 
    Our mission is to provide guidance and resources that remind you of this truth: you are your own healer.
