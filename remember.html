    <h2>The Body Knows</h2>
    <p>
      If cancer grows, it follows a path—cells divide, signals are sent, the immune system is bypassed.<br>
      But if illness follows a route, so must healing.<br>
      The same body that makes room for disease holds the knowledge to undo it.<br>
      The body isn’t confused. It isn’t broken. It’s responding to what it’s been given.<br>
      Change the input. Change the instructions. The body will follow.<br>
      The body knows the way home.
