  <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
  <p>At Unblocked Living, our goal is to share honest, trustworthy content that helps support your wellness journey. As part of that effort, some of the links on this site are affiliate links.</p>

  <p>This means that if you click on a product or service and make a purchase, I may earn a small commission—at no additional cost to you. These commissions help support the cost of running this site and allow me to continue creating content you value.</p>

  <p>All products or services recommended are ones I personally believe in and align with the values of Unblocked Living: natural healing, holistic support, and empowerment.</p>

  <p>If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="mailto:your-email@example.com">contact me directly</a>.</p>
